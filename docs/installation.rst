Installation
============

**This is a short guide on installing the PlanetSCA library.**

.. note::

    Ensure that Python is installed on your system. For data access, you must have an API key from Planet


To Install the package use

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple planetsca


Virtual Environment Setup
-------------------------

For easiest installation, use a virutal environment.

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P)
2. Select Venv
3. Select Desired Interpreter Path (I use 3.12.2, minimum version is 3.8)
4. Notification should show up on the bottom right corner titled "Creating
   environment (Show logs): Creating venv...
5. The venv is set up and activated if you see " *Python Version*
   (.'venv':venv)"
6. *Note* After setting up a venv once, VScode will automatically start up the
   virtual environment alongside with VScode. There is no need to repeat these
   steps unless you do not see step 5.
