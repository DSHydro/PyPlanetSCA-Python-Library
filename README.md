# PlanetSCA

**PlanetSCA** is an open source python library for mapping snow covered areas
(SCA) from high-resolution PlanetScope images using a Random Forest model. This
package was developed from [original work by Kehan Yang and others](#citations).

This library also include access to a
[pre-trained model](https://huggingface.co/geo-smart/planetsca_models) for
mapping SCA in PlanetScope imagery, and
[sample data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/geo-smart/planetsca_datasets) to
demonstrate the library's functions.

The search and download functions require you to have an account with Planet and
an [API key](https://developers.planet.com/quickstart/apis/#find-your-api-key).
