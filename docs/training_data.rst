# Creating a training data set with QGIS and planetsca

##  Introduction

The following instructions describe the steps to create a training data set for a Planet Snow Covered Area (SCA) random forest classifier model. This example will use [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), an open-source geographic information system (GIS) desktop application, but similar steps can be taken in proprietary software like ArcGIS to accomplish the same things.

To create a training data set, we will need access to at least one Planet Scope image where snow is present on the landscape, representative of the region weâ€™d like to map SCA in. We will create a geojson or shapefile (a collection of polygons) outlining areas of snow (labeled ``1``) and areas without snow (labeled ``0``) that we can visually identify.

After creating this file, we will use the training module of the planetsca library to create the final training dataset, with which we can train a new random forest classifier model to detect snow in Planet Scope images.

## Select a sample Planet Scope image

You will need a sample Planet Scope image to create a training data set. You can use the search and download functions of planetsca to retrieve an image you'd like to use. In a new QGIS project, import this image by going to the *Layer* menu, then *Add Layer*, and *Add Raster Layer* (alternatively you can drag and drop the file into the Layers panel).

Here is what that image might look like (this image is ``20240116_170700_24_24b0_3B_AnalyticMS_SR_clip.tif``):

![Example Planet Scope RGB image](/docs/doc_images/training_data_1.jpg "Example Planet Scope RGB image")

This image is displayed as a "Multiband color" image, showing the red, green, and blue bands.

![Layers panel showing RGB](/docs/doc_images/training_data_2.jpg "Layers panel showing RGB")

We could also visualize the fourth, near-infrared (NIR) band as well.

## Create new shapefile layer

We will use polygons (in a shapefile layer) to outline areas of snow or no snow in our sample image.

In the *Layer* menu, go to *Create Layer*, then *New Shapefile Layer*.

![Menu to New Shapefile Layer](/docs/doc_images/training_data_4.jpg "Menu to New Shapefile Layer")

In the window that opens up, give this layer a *file name* (and choose where to save the file). Set the *geometry type* to ``Polygon``. Under *New Field*, create a new field with the *name* ``label``, and *type* ``Integer``, then click *Add to Fields List* and then *OK*.

![New Shapefile Layer options](/docs/doc_images/training_data_5.jpg "New Shapefile Layer options")

You will see your new layer show up in the Layers panel.

![Layers panel showing shapefile layer](/docs/doc_images/training_data_6.jpg "Layers panel showing shapefile layer")

## Label the training dataset

To begin the process of outlining areas of snow or no snow in the sample image, select the shapefile layer in the layers panel, click on the pencil icon in the top menu bar to *toggle editing*, then click on the shape icon to *add polygon feature*.

![Edit and add polygon menu](/docs/doc_images/training_data_7.jpg "Edit and add polygon menu")

Now you can draw a polygon by left-clicking on the sample Planet Scope image. Each time you left-click you will create a new vertex for your polygon. Draw a polygon around an area of open snow that you can visually identify.

![Drawing a polygon feature](/docs/doc_images/training_data_8.jpg "Drawing a polygon feature")

When you have finished drawing the outline, right-click to stop drawing. This will open a *Features Attributes* window. In the *label* field, enter the value ``1`` to label this polygon as outlining an area with snow.

![Feature Attributes for snow](/docs/doc_images/training_data_9.jpg "Feature Attributes for snow")

Click on the same shape icon to *add polygon feature* again. This time, outline an area without snow, and set the *label* field to ``0``.

![Feature Attributes for no snow](/docs/doc_images/training_data_10.jpg "Feature Attributes for no snow")

Repeat for as many snow and no snow areas as you think you'll need. The blue, green, red, and NIR band reflectance values for all pixels within each polygon will be used as training data for the model.

When you are finished, you can click the *save layer edits* icon (save disk icon with small red pencil), then click the yellow pencil icon to turn off *toggle editing* for this layer.

![Save layer edits](/docs/doc_images/training_data_11.jpg "Save layer edits")

You might have something that looks like this now on the map:

![Example map with polygons](/docs/doc_images/training_data_12.jpg "Example map with polygons")

To visualize which polygons are labeled ``0`` for snow and ``1`` for no snow, right click on the shapefile layer in the layers panel, then click *Properties*.

Under *Symbology* change the symbol type from ``Single Symbol`` to ``Categorized``. For *value*, select the ``label`` field. Then click *classify* to automatically assign some colors to each label value. Click *apply* and *OK* to accept these changes and close the properties window.

![shapefile layer symbology options](/docs/doc_images/training_data_13.jpg "shapefile layer symbology options")

Your map might look something like this now:

![Example map with colored polygons](/docs/doc_images/training_data_14.jpg "Example map with colored polygons")

If you need to edit the polygons' labels, you can right-click on your shapefile layer in the layers panel, and click *Open Attribute Table*. Here you can click the yellow pencil icon to toggle editing, select an individual polygon, and edit its label field. Be sure to click the save icon in this window after making any changes that you wish to keep.

![Editing attributes table](/docs/doc_images/training_data_15.jpg "Editing attributes table")

## Export the labeled polygons

Right click on the shapefile layer in the layers panel, and click *Export* then *Save Features As*. Save this as a ``GeoJSON`` format and make sure that the ``label`` field checkbox selected. Click *OK* to export this to a file.

![Export to GeoJSON file](/docs/doc_images/training_data_16.jpg "Export to GeoJSON file")

## Create training data with planetsca

Finally, you can use the planetsca library to create the training data.

```python
# import the planetsca train module
from planetsca import train

# provide filepaths to geojson and sample Planet Scope image
labeled_polygons_filepath = "planetsca_training_data_polygons.geojson"
training_image_filepath = "20240116_170700_24_24b0_3B_AnalyticMS_SR_clip.tif"

# create the training data, also save it to a csv file
training_data_df = train.data_training_new(
    labeled_polygons_filepath,
    training_image_filepath,
    training_data_filepath="my_training_data.csv",
)
```

See the demo Jupyter Notebooks and planetsca documentation for further details.
